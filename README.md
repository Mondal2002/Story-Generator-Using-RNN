# Story-Generator-Using-RNN
This project is a story generation model built using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained on the complete collection of Sherlock Holmes stories. The model learns writing patterns, vocabulary, and sentence structure from Sir Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s original text and generates new, Sherlock-style stories word by word.
